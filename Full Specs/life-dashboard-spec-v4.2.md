## 1. Project Overview

### What Is This?
A personal command center and agency management platform, hosted at exitframe.org. It replaces multiple SaaS tools (ClickUp, Trello, Airtable, Mealime, Zapier workflows) with a single, self-owned application that manages every aspect of Trey's personal life and business operations at Mosaic Life Creative.

### Core Principles
- **Single user** — this is built for Trey. No multi-tenant overhead. Every pixel serves one person.
- **API-first architecture** — the backend is a standalone API that the Next.js frontend consumes as a client. This enables a future Android companion app (React Native) to use the same backend.
- **Dynamic everything** — clients, products, integrations, and modules are all configurable at runtime. No dev work to onboard a new client or spin up a new product.
- **AI as connective tissue** — one Claude-powered AI layer that can see across all data domains, providing chat, proactive insights, and action triggers.
- **AI as project manager** — Claude doesn't just track projects, it manages them. For any project type (construction, development, business, personal), Claude can generate plans, break work into phases, provide step-by-step guidance, and walk Trey through unfamiliar tasks in real time.
- **AI on arrival** — page-load AI prompts surface contextual insights automatically when navigating to key sections, without requiring manual queries.
- **Background intelligence** — scheduled jobs sync external data, process trends, detect anomalies, and surface insights without being asked.
- **SaaS killer** — every module built reduces dependency on paid third-party tools.
- **Phased build** — ship usable chunks, not a monolith.

## 2. Organizational Structure

The dashboard organizes everything into four top-level domains, with dynamic entities within each.

### Life (Personal)
- Health Tracking
- Fitness (Lifting + Swimming Workout Builder)
- Diet & Calorie AI / Meal Planning
- Financial (Net Worth + Spending Analysis via QBO)
- Goal Tracking (tied to real data across all domains)
- **Custom Trackers** (contacts, oil changes, tax payments, renewals — anything)
- Plant Care
- Home Projects (Lawn Care, Maintenance, Construction with AI PM)
- Calendar (Google Calendar integration)

### MLC — Business Operations
- Client Management (dynamic client list with contact info)
- Client Onboarding Templates (one-click new client setup)
- WordPress Site Manager
- Recurring Maintenance Schedules
- Client Communication Hub (email + Twilio SMS)
- Content Calendars (social + email, Trello-style boards, AI content in client voice)
- GA4 Analytics Dashboard
- Social Media Analytics (Meta) + Content Ideation
- Google My Business / Review Sentiment
- Sendy Campaign Metrics
- Client Reports (auto-generated monthly summaries)
- Passive Time Tracking & Client Profitability
- Financial (Business books via QBO)
- Automations / Rules Engine
- Calendar (Google Calendar integration)

### MLC — Client Workspaces (Dynamic)
Each client gets their own workspace with toggleable modules:
- Notes (including meeting notes with AI action detection)
- Project Tracking / To-Do Lists
- Content Calendar (with client sharing)
- Maintenance Logs
- GA4 Analytics (if connected)
- Social Media Analytics (if connected)
- Google Reviews / Sentiment Reports (if connected)
- Email Campaign Metrics (if connected)
- Client Voice Profile (tone, vocabulary, examples for AI content)
- Monthly Reports (auto-generated, shareable)
- Contact Information (name, email, phone — used in email/SMS personalization)
- Time Spent / Profitability

**Current clients include:** BCA Mechanical, Defense Link, Cristy's, Papa Boo's — but the system supports unlimited clients created at any time.

### Cross-Domain Systems
- AI Chat + Page-Load Insights + Background Intelligence
- Global Activity Feed
- Data Export & Backup
- Demo Mode & Architecture Showcase (future)

### Products (Dynamic)
Each product gets its own workspace with configurable modules:
- GetShelfed.com — game scheduling admin
- ManlyMan.men — stubbed for future (content scheduling, analytics TBD)
- MLC Website — quest game monitoring, AI sharing stats
- Grove City Events — event scraping, staging, publishing (with featured images), newsletter builder
- Web Dev Tools — WordPress plugin analytics (Freemius + WordPress.org), download tracking, revenue, reviews, version adoption, development roadmap

**New products can be created at any time** with whatever modules are relevant. All products get access to Custom Product Metrics (user-defined KPIs with charts and AI analysis) and Generic API Connectors (pull data from any REST API without custom code).

## 3. Design Direction

### Login Screen (exitframe.org landing)
- **Aesthetic:** Top-secret / military / classified
- Dark background (near black or very dark charcoal)
- Subtle animated elements — scan lines, grid pulse, particle field, or matrix-style rain (tasteful, not cheesy)
- Monospace font for input fields
- Minimal branding — small logo mark or wordmark, nothing loud
- **2FA required** — after password, prompt for TOTP code (authenticator app)
- "Authenticating..." animation sequence on submit
- Possibly a brief "ACCESS GRANTED" confirmation before dashboard loads
- No indication of what the site actually does — it just looks like a secure terminal
- **Failed login redirect:** After failed authentication, redirect the user to fbi.gov. No error message, no "try again" — just a clean redirect to the FBI's website. 🫡

### Authenticated Dashboard
- **Aesthetic:** Sleek, modern, clean
- Light or dark mode (user toggle, default dark to match login vibe)
- Dashboard-first homepage with widget-style cards for key metrics across all domains
- Left sidebar navigation organized by domain (Life, MLC, Products)
- Dead simple — if something takes more than one click to find, it's wrong
- Responsive, but desktop-primary (mobile companion app handles mobile use case later)
- Consistent component library — cards, tables, charts, forms all share a design language
- Data visualization using clean charts (Recharts or similar)

### General UI Principles
- No clutter. White space is a feature.
- Progressive disclosure — show summary first, drill down on click
- Toasts/notifications for background AI insights ("Your HRV dropped 15% this week")
- Command palette (Cmd+K style) for quick navigation and AI chat access
- **Page-load AI insights** — when navigating to key sections (Health, Fitness, Financial, etc.), the AI automatically generates and displays contextual insights at the top of the page. No need to open chat or ask a question.

## 4. Tech Stack & Architecture

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14+** (App Router) — React-based, supports SSR/SSG, great DX
- **TypeScript** — type safety across the entire codebase
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling, easy to maintain consistent design
- **Shadcn/ui** — component library built on Radix, highly customizable
- **Recharts** — data visualization
- **Zustand or Jotai** — lightweight client state management

### Backend (API-First)
- **Next.js API Routes** as a thin layer, OR a separate Express/Fastify server
- **Recommendation:** Start with Next.js API routes organized as a clean REST API with clear separation. If the Android app requires a fully decoupled backend later, extract to a standalone server.
- All API routes follow RESTful conventions and are documented
- Authentication via middleware — every route is protected

### Database
- **Supabase** (managed PostgreSQL) — already in use for ManlyMan, keeps everything consolidated
- **Prisma ORM** — type-safe database access, migrations, schema management
- **Supabase Storage** — file storage for food photos, recipe images, GCE event featured images, document uploads
- **Supabase Auth** — built-in 2FA (TOTP) support, handles the authentication layer cleanly

### Background Jobs & Caching
- **Upstash Redis** — serverless Redis, job queue and caching layer
- **BullMQ** — job scheduling and processing (runs on Redis)
- Jobs include: Oura sync, Suunto sync, GA4 pull, Meta pull, Sendy pull, QBO sync, Google Calendar sync, AI analysis runs, GCE scraping, weekly rollups

### AI
- **Claude API (Anthropic)** — all AI functionality
  - Chat / conversational interface
  - Vision (food photo calorie estimation)
  - Analysis (trend detection, anomaly detection, cross-domain insights)
  - Content generation (client emails, newsletter copy, social content ideation)
  - Data cleanup (GCE scraped events)
  - Workout building (lifting + swimming programs)
  - Meal planning and recipe building
  - Page-load contextual insights

### Authentication
- **Supabase Auth** with email/password + **TOTP 2FA**
- JWT session tokens
- API key authentication option for future Android app
- **Failed login behavior:** Redirect to fbi.gov

### Hosting
- **Vercel** — hosts the Next.js application (purpose-built for Next.js)
  - Free tier likely sufficient for single user
  - Pro ($20/mo) if needed for additional serverless function execution time
- **SiteGround** — continues hosting all WordPress sites (client sites, GCE, MLC, etc.)
- **Supabase** — database, auth, file storage (managed, no server maintenance)
- **Upstash** — serverless Redis (no server to manage)
- **AWS** — S3 for Sendy assets (already using with credits)
- Domain: exitframe.org pointed to Vercel
- SSL included via Vercel

### Communication
- **Twilio** — SMS messaging for client texts, personal reminders, alert notifications
- **Gmail API** — send client emails from Trey's email address

### Integration Architecture
- Each integration is registered as a record in an `integrations` table
- Integrations have a status (active, paused, error), last sync timestamp, and configuration JSON
- New integrations are added by creating a new integration module — no changes to core architecture
- Sync jobs are managed by BullMQ and can be triggered manually or on schedule
- All synced data lands in domain-specific tables, not a generic blob

**Not Built Until:** Way late in development (Phase 12). Everything else ships first.

---

### Module 22: Content Calendars & Client Sharing (Replaces Trello)

**Purpose:** Plan, organize, and share content schedules for social media and email clients. Trello-style board/calendar view with AI content generation in each client's brand voice.

**Key Features:**

**Content Calendar:**
- Create monthly content calendars per client (social, email, or mixed)
- **Calendar view** — visual month view showing scheduled content by date
- **Board view** — Trello-style columns (Idea → Draft → Ready → Scheduled → Published)
- Entries include: platform, content type, copy/caption, hashtags, image notes, scheduled date/time
- Drag and drop to rearrange or reschedule
- Status tracking per entry (idea → draft → ready → scheduled → published → skipped)
- Link content ideas from Module 14 (social ideation) and Module 15 (email ideation) directly into calendar entries

**AI Content Generation:**
- **Client voice profiles** — each client has a defined tone, vocabulary, example content, target audience, and brand guidelines
- "Generate 8 Instagram post ideas for Papa Boo's for March" → Claude generates ideas in Papa Boo's voice, informed by what content performs best
- "Write the caption for this carousel post about our spring menu" → Claude writes copy that sounds like the client, not like AI
- AI can populate an entire month's calendar draft from a few prompts
- Email campaign content drafted in client voice with subject lines, preview text, and body

**Client Sharing:**
- **Generate a secure share link** for any content calendar → client can view (read-only) at a unique URL like exitframe.org/share/{token}
- Client sees a clean, branded view of their content calendar — no dashboard chrome, no other client data
- **Client can approve entries** — simple approve/flag mechanism on shared view (tracked via `client_approved` field)
- Share links can be:
  - Password-protected (optional)
  - Time-limited (expiration date)
  - Revoked at any time
  - Tracked (last accessed, access count)
- **Also shareable:** Project status views, custom reports — anything you want a client to see without giving them dashboard access

**Email Content Planning:**
- For Sendy/email clients, plan campaigns alongside social content
- AI drafts campaign content in client voice
- Subject line A/B suggestions based on past open rate data
- Planned campaigns can be pushed to Sendy when ready

---

### Module 23: Passive Time Tracking & Client Profitability

**Purpose:** Automatically track time spent per client/module without any manual input. Surface profitability insights.

**Key Features:**
- **100% hands-off** — time is tracked by monitoring which module/client workspace you're active in. No timers, no start/stop, no logging.
- Idle detection — stops counting after inactivity threshold (e.g., 5 minutes)
- Auto-generates time entries with activity descriptions ("Editing BCA content calendar — 22 min", "Reviewing Defense Link GA4 — 8 min")
- Per-client time summaries (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Client profitability view** — compare hours spent vs revenue per client (revenue from QBO or manual entry)
- Effective hourly rate calculation per client
- Trend tracking — are you spending more or less time on this client over time?

**AI Integration:**
- "You spent 14 hours on BCA this month vs 3 hours on Defense Link, but they're at the same rate. Worth revisiting BCA's scope?"
- Monthly profitability insights on page load
- Flags clients trending toward unprofitability

---

### Module 24: Google My Business + Review Sentiment

**Purpose:** Sync Google reviews and generate monthly sentiment reports for clients like Cristy's.

**Key Features:**
- Connect client GMB locations via Google Business Profile API
- Sync all reviews (rating, text, date, replies)
- **AI sentiment classification** — each review tagged as positive/neutral/negative with theme tags (food quality, service speed, cleanliness, atmosphere, etc.)
- **Monthly sentiment reports** — auto-generated narrative analysis:
  - Total reviews, average rating, sentiment breakdown
  - Top themes (what people love, what they complain about)
  - Trends vs previous months
  - AI recommendations ("Negative reviews mentioning wait times increased 40% — consider addressing staffing during Friday dinner rush")
- **Shareable via client link** — same secure sharing system as content calendars
- Review response tracking (ties into existing Zap auto-responses)

**Page-Load AI:** Client's GMB section shows latest review summary and any concerning trends.

**AI Integration:**
- Monthly sentiment report generation
- Theme extraction and trend analysis
- Recommendations based on review patterns
- Alerts for negative review spikes

---

### Module 25: Client Reports (Auto-Generated)

**Purpose:** One-click monthly reports per client pulling data from all connected services.

**Key Features:**
- **AI auto-generates monthly client reports** combining:
  - Maintenance performed (from WP site manager)
  - Analytics highlights (from GA4 — traffic, top pages, trends)
  - Social media performance (from Meta — engagement, reach, best posts)
  - Content published (from content calendar)
  - Email campaign results (from Sendy)
  - Review sentiment summary (from GMB, if connected)
  - Time spent on client (from passive tracking)
- Reports rendered as clean HTML — professional and readable
- **Configurable sections** — toggle which sections to include per client
- **Shareable via secure link** — clients see a polished report, not your dashboard
- Report history — archive of all past reports per client
- **Bulk generation** — "Generate all client reports for February" in one action

**AI Integration:**
- Pulls data from all connected services and writes a narrative summary
- Highlights wins, flags concerns, suggests next steps
- Reports written in a professional but personable tone
- "BCA's organic traffic is up 12% this month, largely driven by the new service pages we launched. Plugin updates were completed on schedule with no issues."

---

### Module 26: Recurring Maintenance Schedules

**Purpose:** Automate WP maintenance workflows so nothing falls through the cracks.

**Key Features:**
- Create recurring schedules per site or across all sites (e.g., "Monthly plugin updates for all client sites")
- Frequency options: weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly
- When a schedule comes due, auto-creates a Task in the project tracker
- Track completion per site per schedule cycle
- Flag overdue maintenance
- Ties into existing MaintenanceLog when work is completed

**AI Integration:**
- "BCA hasn't had a plugin update in 6 weeks — last scheduled run was skipped"
- Auto-generates maintenance summary for client reports
- Suggests schedule adjustments based on update frequency patterns

---

### Module 27: Global Activity Feed

**Purpose:** Unified "what happened" view across every domain and module.

**Key Features:**
- Chronological feed of all activity: tasks completed, emails sent, content published, maintenance performed, meals logged, workouts tracked, events scraped, reviews synced, etc.
- **Filter by domain** (Life, MLC, specific client, specific product)
- **Filter by module** (WordPress, content, analytics, health, etc.)
- **Filter by activity type** (created, completed, sent, published, etc.)
- **Search** the feed
- Date range selection
- Quick reference links — click any entry to jump to the source record
- Different from the dashboard homepage (which is widgets/summary) — this is a detailed log

**AI Integration:**
- Daily/weekly activity summaries on request
- "What did I do for BCA this month?" → AI filters and summarizes
- Cross-domain pattern detection from activity data

---

### Module 28: Goal Tracking

**Purpose:** Set goals tied to real data, track progress, get AI coaching.

**Key Features:**
- Create goals in any domain: health, fitness, financial, business, project, learning, custom
- **Goal types:**
  - **Target value** — "Hit 185 lbs" (auto-tracked from health metrics)
  - **Target date** — "Complete garage drywall by March 15" (linked to project)
  - **Habit** — "Log meals every day" (tracked from activity)
  - **Milestone** — "Land 2 new clients this quarter" (manual tracking)
- **Auto-link to existing data** — weight goals pull from health metrics, financial goals pull from QBO/net worth, project goals pull from project completion status
- Progress percentage computed automatically where possible
- **Check-ins** — periodic progress entries with AI feedback
- Visual progress tracking (progress bars, trend lines)
- Status indicators: on track, at risk, behind, completed
- Dashboard widget showing active goals at a glance

**AI Integration:**
- "You're 3 lbs from your weight goal with 6 weeks to go — you're ahead of pace"
- "Your savings goal is at risk — spending was $800 over budget last month"
- Goal suggestions based on patterns: "You've been consistently swimming 3x/week. Want to set a distance goal?"
- Weekly goal progress in cross-domain rollup
- Connects to fitness (Oura readiness), health, financial, and project data for holistic assessment

---

### Module 29: Data Export & Backup

**Purpose:** Protect the investment. Regular automated backups of all dashboard data.

**Key Features:**
- **Scheduled full exports** — weekly or monthly, configurable
- Export as JSON (preserves structure) or CSV (human-readable)
- Stored in Supabase Storage (or optionally S3)
- **Retention policy** — keep last N backups, auto-delete older ones
- **On-demand export** — full or filtered by domain/module
- **Export history** — see all past exports, download any
- File size tracking
- Failure alerting (Twilio SMS if a scheduled export fails)

**Technical Notes:**
- BullMQ job handles the export process
- Iterates all tables, serializes to JSON/CSV
- Compresses before upload
- Not a database-level backup (that's Supabase's built-in) — this is an application-level data export you fully control and can restore from anywhere

---

### Module 30: Client Onboarding Templates

**Purpose:** Automate the repetitive setup when onboarding a new client.

**Key Features:**
- Create reusable templates (e.g., "New WordPress Client", "Social Media Only", "Full Service")
- Each template defines a sequence of onboarding steps:
  - Create client workspace
  - Enable services (WordPress, GA4, social, content calendar, GMB, etc.)
  - Install WP plugin on client site (manual step, flagged as to-do)
  - Connect GA4 property
  - Create initial content calendar
  - Create onboarding project with tasks
  - Set up recurring maintenance schedule
  - Draft welcome email
- **One-click onboarding** — select client + template → everything is scaffolded
- Track which steps completed/failed
- Customizable per run — skip steps that don't apply
- **Default template** — set one template as the starting point for all new clients

**AI Integration:**
- "New client BCA Mechanical added — suggest onboarding template: 'Full Service WordPress Client'?"
- AI can suggest template modifications based on the client's stated needs
- Auto-populates welcome email draft in client voice

---

### Module 31: Automations / Rules Engine

**Purpose:** Simple if/then rules that run without AI — lightweight triggers for common patterns.

**Key Features:**
- Create rules with a trigger → action pattern:
  - **Schedule triggers** — run on a cron (e.g., "Every Monday at 9am")
  - **Event triggers** — fire when something happens (e.g., "Maintenance schedule overdue")
  - **Condition triggers** — fire when data matches a condition (e.g., "Content calendar entry still in draft status past scheduled date")
- **Available actions:**
  - Create a task
  - Send SMS (via Twilio)
  - Send a notification in the dashboard
  - Flag a record
  - Log to activity feed
  - Draft an email
- Rule builder UI — no code, just dropdowns and fields
- Enable/disable rules
- Trigger log — see when each rule fired and what it did

**Example Rules:**
- "If any client site has a core update available for more than 7 days → create task + send me a text"
- "If a content calendar entry hits its scheduled date and status is still 'draft' → flag it and send notification"
- "If any client has no content planned for next week → send me a Monday morning notification"
- "If Oura readiness score drops below 60 → suggest lighter workout in fitness module"
- "If a plant hasn't been watered past its due date by 2 days → text me"

**Difference from AI:** These are deterministic rules, not AI intelligence. They run reliably, cheaply, and instantly. AI handles nuance and analysis; rules handle "if X then Y" logic.

---

### Module 32: Custom Trackers (The "Odds & Ends" System)

**Purpose:** A flexible, user-defined tracking system for anything that doesn't warrant its own module. This is the catch-all for the random things you want to track, get reminded about, or log over time — without needing a spec change for each one.

**The Problem It Solves:** You'll constantly think of things: "I should track when I change my contacts," "I need to remember estimated tax payments," "When was my last oil change?" Each of these is too small for a module but too important to forget. Custom Trackers gives you a single system that handles all of them.

**Tracker Types:**

1. **Recurring** — Something you do on a schedule.
   - Change contacts every 30 days
   - Oil change every 5,000 miles or 6 months
   - Replace HVAC filter every 90 days
   - Quarterly estimated tax payments
   - Annual car registration renewal
   - Rotate mattress every 3 months

2. **Value Log** — Track a value over time, see trends.
   - Blood pressure readings (not part of formal health module)
   - Tire tread depth
   - Home water heater temperature
   - Anything you want to graph

3. **Checklist** — Periodic lists of steps.
   - Annual tax prep checklist (gather W-2s, 1099s, deductions, file)
   - Seasonal home maintenance (clean gutters, winterize, etc.)
   - Vehicle inspection prep

4. **Countdown** — Tracking toward a specific date.
   - Passport expiration (June 2028)
   - Driver's license renewal
   - Domain name renewals
   - Warranty expiration dates

**Key Features:**
- **Create any tracker in seconds** — name it, pick a type, set a schedule or date, done
- **Automatic next-due calculation** — complete an entry, next due date auto-calculates
- **Reminders via notification + optional SMS** — configurable advance notice (remind me 3 days before, remind me day of)
- **Cost tracking per entry** — "Contacts cost $180 this time" → AI can tell you yearly cost
- **Metadata** — flexible extra fields per tracker (brand, mileage, etc.)
- **Link to goals** — optionally tie a tracker to a goal ("I want to reduce contact lens cost")
- **Dashboard widget** — overdue and upcoming items at a glance
- **History** — see all past entries per tracker with dates and notes
- **Categories** — health, financial, home, vehicle, personal, business, custom

**AI Integration:**
- "Your contacts are 3 days overdue"
- "You've spent $720 on oil changes this year across 4 changes — might be worth looking into synthetic oil to extend intervals"
- "Estimated tax payment due in 12 days — $1,200 based on last quarter"
- "Your passport expires in 8 months — you might want to start renewal soon, processing times are currently 6-8 weeks"
- Custom trackers feed into the cross-domain AI rollup — the AI sees the full picture of your life
- The AI can suggest new trackers based on patterns: "You've mentioned your water heater a few times — want to set up a maintenance tracker?"

**Why This Matters for Architecture:**
Custom Trackers is designed so that the system grows with you without growing the codebase. One table, one set of CRUD endpoints, one context provider. Whether you have 5 trackers or 50, the system handles it identically. When you think of something new to track next Tuesday, you just create a tracker — no development needed.

---

### Module 33: WordPress Plugin Analytics & Roadmap (Web Dev Tools)

**Purpose:** Full product intelligence for the Web Dev Tools WordPress plugin — downloads, revenue, reviews, version health, and release planning. Pulls data from two sources: the Freemius API (sales, licensing, installs, revenue, deactivation analytics) and the WordPress.org public API (download counts, ratings, reviews, support threads, version adoption). Together they give a complete picture of how the plugin is performing, what users think of it, and where to focus development effort.

**External APIs:**

**Freemius REST API** (requires API key + developer ID):
- Authentication: API key + secret, signed requests
- Endpoints used:
  - `/v1/developers/{id}/plugins/{id}/installs.json` — active installs, install history
  - `/v1/developers/{id}/plugins/{id}/payments.json` — revenue, MRR, transactions
  - `/v1/developers/{id}/plugins/{id}/licenses.json` — license breakdown (free, trial, paid, expired, refunded)
  - `/v1/developers/{id}/plugins/{id}/plans.json` — plan distribution
  - `/v1/developers/{id}/plugins/{id}/uninstalls.json` — deactivation reasons with counts
  - `/v1/developers/{id}/plugins/{id}/installs/geo.json` — geographic distribution of installs
- Sync frequency: daily (scheduled BullMQ job)

**WordPress.org Public API** (no auth required):
- Plugin info: `https://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.2/?action=plugin_information&slug={slug}`
  - Returns: download count, active install bracket, rating, num_ratings, version, tested_up_to, requires_php, sections (description, changelog, FAQ), tags
- Plugin stats: `https://api.wordpress.org/stats/plugin/1.0/downloads.php?slug={slug}&historical_summary=1`
  - Returns: daily download counts, historical totals
- Reviews: `https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/{slug}/reviews/` (scrape or RSS — no clean API for individual reviews)
- Support threads: `https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/{slug}/` (scrape for open/resolved counts)
- Sync frequency: daily for stats, twice daily for reviews

**Key Features:**

**Performance Dashboard (Product workspace → Analytics tab):**
- Active installs (from Freemius — exact count, not WP.org's bracket)
- Install growth trend (line chart — daily/weekly/monthly)
- Total downloads (WP.org)
- Download velocity (downloads per day/week, trend)
- Geographic install heatmap or top-10 countries table

**Revenue & Licensing (if plugin goes paid / freemium):**
- MRR (monthly recurring revenue) trend
- Total revenue, lifetime
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)
- License breakdown: free / trial / paid / expired / refunded (pie chart)
- Plan distribution (if multiple tiers)
- Trial-to-paid conversion rate
- Churn rate (monthly)
- Refund rate and refund reasons
- Revenue milestones ("Hit $500 MRR on March 12")

**Reviews & Sentiment:**
- Current star rating + total review count (WP.org)
- Rating distribution (5-star breakdown bar)
- Individual review list with text, rating, date, reviewer
- **AI sentiment analysis** — reuse the same engine as GMB reviews (Module 24):
  - Each review tagged with sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
  - Theme tags extracted (e.g., "performance", "UI_confusion", "compatibility", "documentation", "support_quality", "feature_request")
  - Monthly sentiment report: trends, top themes, concerns
- Review response tracking (if you reply on WP.org, log it here)
- Alerts for negative review spikes

**Support Health:**
- Open support thread count
- Resolved thread count
- Resolution rate
- Average response time (if trackable)
- Trend over time

**Version Adoption:**
- Current latest version
- Version distribution pie chart (what % of users are on each version)
- "Tested up to" WordPress version compatibility status
- Alert if a new WP major version ships and your "tested up to" is behind
- Alert if adoption of latest version is slow (possible update issue)

**Deactivation Analytics (Freemius):**
- Deactivation reason breakdown (pie/bar chart)
- Top reasons with counts
- Trend over time — are deactivation reasons shifting?
- Correlation detection: deactivation spike after WP core update → flag compatibility concern

**Development Roadmap:**
- **Version planning** — define upcoming releases (v1.3, v1.4, v2.0) with target dates and status (planning, in_development, testing, released)
- **Feature tracking** — link tasks from the project tracker to specific versions
  - Each version shows: planned features, bugs to fix, completion progress
  - Kanban or list view of features per version
- **Changelog management** — write/edit rich-text release notes per version in the dashboard
  - AI can draft changelog from completed tasks: "Based on the 6 tasks completed in v1.4, here's a draft..."
  - Option to publish changelog to WP.org (manual copy or future API integration)
- **Release history** — timeline view of all past releases with dates, download counts at release, and changelogs
- **Beta tester management** (optional, stretch) — list of beta testers, distribute pre-release zips, collect feedback

**AI Integration:**
- **Weekly product health summary** (page-load insight): "Active installs up 3.2% this week (247 → 255). 2 new reviews (both 5-star). 1 open support thread about CSS conflicts with Elementor — no response yet."
- **Review sentiment analysis**: "Users consistently praise the speed audit tool but 3 reviews this month mention the settings panel being confusing — consider a UX pass for v1.5."
- **Deactivation pattern detection**: "Deactivation spike of 12% after WordPress 6.5 release, with 8 users citing 'plugin caused errors.' Likely compatibility issue — prioritize testing."
- **Changelog drafting**: Takes the completed tasks for a version and writes professional release notes.
- **Version adoption alerts**: "v1.4 has been out for 2 weeks but only 34% of users have updated. Typical adoption at this point is 60%+. Check if auto-update is working correctly."
- **Revenue forecasting** (if paid): "At current growth rate, you'll hit $1K MRR by July."
- **Competitive intelligence suggestion**: "Based on your feature set and the reviews mentioning [feature], you might consider adding [X] — it's a common request in this plugin category."

**Dashboard Widgets (Web Dev Tools product workspace):**
- Active installs (number + sparkline trend)
- MRR or total revenue (if applicable)
- Current rating (stars + count)
- Open support threads
- Latest reviews (last 3, with sentiment badges)
- Version adoption (mini pie chart)
- Next release progress (tasks done / total, target date)
- Deactivation rate (percentage + trend)

---

### Module 34: Custom Product Metrics

**Purpose:** Let any product track custom KPIs without writing code. This is the product-level equivalent of Custom Trackers (Module 32) — where Custom Trackers handle personal life things (oil changes, contacts, tax payments), Custom Product Metrics handle business and product things (monthly active users, conversion rates, subscriber counts, app store ratings, error rates, whatever matters for that product).

**The Problem It Solves:** Every product has unique metrics that matter. GetShelfed might care about daily active players and games completed. ManlyMan might care about subscriber count and email open rates. A future SaaS product might care about MRR, churn, and NPS score. Without this module, every new product needs custom development to track its KPIs. With it, you create a product, define the metrics you care about, and start logging values — instantly get charts, trends, goal tracking, and AI analysis.

**Key Features:**

**Metric Definition:**
- Create any metric on any product: name, unit, format (number, currency, percentage, duration, custom), display color
- Optional target value (goal line on charts)
- Optional direction preference: "higher is better" (revenue, users) or "lower is better" (churn, error rate, bounce rate)
- Group metrics into categories for organization (Growth, Revenue, Engagement, Quality, custom)
- Reorder metrics to control dashboard layout

**Data Entry:**
- **Manual entry** — log a value for a date (e.g., "MAU: 1,247 on Feb 22")
- **Bulk import** — paste CSV of historical values or upload a file
- **Scheduled reminders** — "Remind me every Monday to log GetShelfed weekly stats"
- **API entry** (future, via Module 35) — metrics can be updated automatically from external API connectors

**Visualization:**
- Per-metric line chart with configurable time range (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, all)
- Goal line overlay if target is set
- Trend indicator (up/down arrow with percentage change)
- Sparkline in compact view for dashboard widgets
- Multi-metric comparison view (overlay 2-3 metrics on one chart to spot correlations)

**Product KPI Dashboard:**
- Each product's workspace gets a "Metrics" tab showing all defined metrics
- Configurable layout — grid of metric cards, each with current value, trend, and sparkline
- Expand any card to see full chart and history
- "Log Values" button — quick-entry form for all metrics at once (great for weekly check-ins)

**AI Integration:**
- **Trend detection**: "GetShelfed daily active players have declined 15% over the past 3 weeks. This started around the same time you pushed v2.1 — might be worth investigating."
- **Correlation spotting**: "ManlyMan email open rates track closely with your posting frequency. Weeks where you post 3+ times see 40% higher opens."
- **Goal progress**: "MLC Website conversion rate is at 2.8%, up from 2.1% last month. At this pace you'll hit your 3.5% target by April."
- **Anomaly alerts**: "GetShelfed error rate spiked to 12% yesterday — normal is under 2%. Check server logs."
- **Weekly product health** in cross-domain rollup: AI summarizes all product metrics alongside client work and personal goals
- **Suggested metrics**: "You created GetShelfed but haven't defined any metrics yet. For a game product, you might want to track: daily active players, games completed per day, average session duration, and retention rate."

**Why This Matters:**
This makes products first-class citizens in the dashboard from day one. You don't need a Freemius integration or a custom API connector to start getting value from a product workspace. Create the product, define 5 metrics, log values weekly, and the AI immediately has context to analyze your product alongside everything else. When API connectors come online (Module 35), manual metrics can be upgraded to auto-populated ones without losing any history.

### Module 35: Generic API Connectors

**Purpose:** Pull data from any REST API into the dashboard without writing custom integration code. This is the module that makes Module 33 (WordPress Plugin Analytics) the last bespoke integration you ever need to build. Everything after it is configured, not coded.

**The Problem It Solves:** Every external service has its own API — Stripe, Gumroad, Shopify, Plausible Analytics, GitHub, App Store Connect, Google Search Console, Mailchimp, ConvertKit, any webhook-capable service. Building a dedicated module for each one is unsustainable. Generic API Connectors let you point the dashboard at any API, tell it what data to extract, and have it automatically sync on a schedule. The data feeds into Custom Product Metrics, dashboard widgets, and the AI context.

**Key Features:**

**Connector Configuration:**
- Name, description, associated product (optional — connectors can be product-level or global)
- Base URL (e.g., `https://api.stripe.com/v1`)
- Authentication type:
  - API key (header or query param)
  - Bearer token
  - OAuth 2.0 (client credentials or authorization code flow)
  - Basic auth
  - Custom header
- Default headers (content-type, accept, etc.)
- Rate limit configuration (max requests per minute/hour — respects API limits)
- Enabled/disabled toggle

**Endpoint Definitions (multiple per connector):**
- Path (e.g., `/charges?limit=100&created[gte]={{start_date}}`)
- HTTP method (GET, POST)
- Template variables — use `{{variable}}` syntax for dynamic values (dates, IDs, pagination cursors)
- Response mapping — JSONPath or dot-notation to extract values from the response:
  ```
  Extract "total_revenue" from "data.summary.total" as currency
  Extract "subscriber_count" from "data.total_items" as number
  Extract "items" from "data.results[]" as array → iterate and extract fields
  ```
- Transform rules (optional): sum, count, average, min, max, latest, or custom JavaScript expression
- Destination: which Custom Product Metric(s) to update, or store raw in a generic data table

**Sync Configuration:**
- Schedule: hourly, every 6 hours, daily, weekly, manual only
- Sync window: what date range to fetch (last 24h, last 7d, since last sync)
- Retry policy: retry on failure (1x, 3x, 5x) with exponential backoff
- Error handling: log error, send notification, disable after N consecutive failures

**Sync Execution:**
- BullMQ job per connector, scheduled via cron
- Each sync run logged: timestamp, status, data points fetched, errors
- Sync history viewable per connector (last 30 runs with status)
- Manual "Sync Now" button for testing
- Dry run mode — execute the API call, show what would be extracted, but don't write data

**Data Flow:**
```
External API → Connector fetches data → Response mapping extracts values
  → Values written to Custom Product Metrics (auto-logged with timestamp)
  → OR values written to generic ConnectorDataPoint table for raw storage
  → Activity feed logs the sync
  → AI context includes latest synced data
```

**Connector Templates (pre-built configurations you can import):**
- **Stripe** — MRR, total revenue, active subscriptions, churn, refunds
- **Gumroad** — sales, revenue, product views, conversion rate
- **GitHub** — stars, forks, open issues, PR count, contributor count
- **Plausible/Fathom** — pageviews, unique visitors, bounce rate, top pages
- **Mailchimp/ConvertKit** — subscriber count, open rate, click rate, list growth
- **Google Search Console** — impressions, clicks, average position, top queries
- **Shopify** — orders, revenue, average order value, inventory levels
- **App Store Connect** — downloads, ratings, crash rate
- **Custom webhook receiver** — accept POST payloads from any service that supports webhooks

Templates are just pre-filled connector configurations. User can import one, enter their API credentials, and they're syncing within minutes.

**Connector Builder UI:**
- Step 1: Name the connector, pick auth type, enter credentials
- Step 2: Define endpoints — URL, method, test the request and see raw response
- Step 3: Map response fields — visual JSON tree with click-to-select, define extraction paths
- Step 4: Set destination — which product metric to populate, or raw storage
- Step 5: Configure schedule and error handling
- Step 6: Test sync (dry run) → review extracted data → activate

**Security:**
- All API keys and secrets encrypted at rest (Supabase vault or application-level encryption)
- Credentials never exposed in API responses or frontend
- Connector test mode doesn't persist data
- Audit log for all credential changes

**AI Integration:**
- AI has access to all connector data through Custom Product Metrics — no special handling needed
- AI can flag connector health: "Your Stripe connector has failed 3 times in a row — API key may have been rotated"
- AI can suggest connectors: "You mentioned tracking Gumroad sales for ManlyMan — want me to help set up a Gumroad connector?"
- When analyzing product health, AI naturally incorporates live API data alongside manually logged metrics

**Why This Matters for Architecture:**
This is the module that scales the dashboard indefinitely. Without it, every new data source means a new module with custom code — a Freemius module, a Stripe module, a GitHub module, each taking days to build. With Generic API Connectors, adding a new data source takes 10 minutes of configuration. The connector templates make common sources even faster. Combined with Custom Product Metrics, you have a complete self-service product intelligence platform: define what you want to track, point it at the data source, and the dashboard handles the rest — syncing, charting, trending, and AI analysis.

## 8. AI Architecture

### Core Approach: One Brain, Dynamic Context

A single Claude API integration serves all AI needs. The AI layer dynamically loads relevant context based on where the user is and what they're asking.

### Context Loading Strategy

When an AI request is made (via chat, background job, or page load):

1. **Determine scope** — is this global, domain-specific, or module-specific?
2. **Load relevant data** — pull recent records from appropriate tables
3. **Build context window** — assemble a system prompt + data payload that fits within Claude's context limits
4. **Include cross-domain data when relevant** — "I'm feeling bad" triggers health + fitness + project + calendar data loading
5. **Call Claude API** — with appropriate model (Sonnet for quick stuff/page loads, Opus for deep analysis)
6. **Process response** — parse, store insight if applicable, present to user

### Context Assembly Architecture (Deep Dive)

Claude has no memory between API calls. Every request is a blank slate. The **Context Assembler** is the middleware layer that makes Claude feel omniscient by building the right context payload for every call. This is the most important piece of infrastructure in the AI system.

#### The Seven Layers

**Layer 1: Static System Prompt (~500 tokens, never changes)**
Every Claude call starts with a base identity prompt:
- "You are the AI brain for Trey's Mosaic Life Dashboard."
- Brief system overview: personal life tracking, MLC agency operations, product management
- Behavioral guidelines: be direct, be specific, reference real data, flag concerns
- Current date/time (injected dynamically)
- This layer gives Claude orientation but zero actual data

**Layer 2: Location-Aware Context Assembly (the smart part)**
When a Claude call is triggered, the assembler receives a context request:

```typescript
interface ContextRequest {
  domain: 'life' | 'mlc' | 'product' | 'global';
  module: string;           // 'health', 'client_workspace', 'fitness', etc.
  trigger: 'page_load' | 'chat' | 'background' | 'action';
  entityId?: string;        // client_id, project_id, product_id
  userMessage?: string;     // for chat triggers — used to detect cross-domain needs
}
```

The assembler looks up the context scoping rules (see table below) and calls the appropriate **Context Providers** — small, focused functions that each know how to fetch and summarize data from one domain.

**Layer 3: Context Providers (modular data fetchers)**
Each domain/module has a registered context provider. Providers return lean, pre-summarized data — never raw database dumps.

```
Context Providers:
├── HealthContextProvider      → latest weight, trend, Oura scores, flags, recent blood work
├── FitnessContextProvider     → this week's workouts, volume trend, PRs, next scheduled
├── DietContextProvider        → today's meals, weekly macro averages, active meal plan
├── FinancialContextProvider   → month spending vs budget, net worth trend, notable transactions
├── ClientContextProvider      → client profile, voice profile, active projects, recent notes
├── WPMaintenanceProvider      → site health status, overdue updates, last maintenance per site
├── AnalyticsContextProvider   → GA4 week-over-week, social engagement summary, campaign stats
├── GMBContextProvider         → recent reviews, sentiment trend, last report summary
├── ContentCalendarProvider    → upcoming scheduled content, gaps, pending approvals
├── ProjectContextProvider     → active projects, current phases, upcoming tasks, blockers
├── GoalContextProvider        → active goals, progress %, on-track/at-risk status
├── CalendarContextProvider    → today's events, upcoming deadlines, scheduling conflicts
├── PlantContextProvider       → plants needing water, overdue plants
├── GCEContextProvider         → pending events for review, next newsletter status
├── ActivityFeedProvider       → recent activity summary (filtered by scope)
├── TimeTrackingProvider       → hours this week/month per client, profitability flags
├── CustomTrackerProvider      → active trackers, overdue items, upcoming reminders
└── AutomationProvider         → recent rule triggers, any failures
```

Each provider implements the same interface:
```typescript
interface ContextProvider {
  getSummary(entityId?: string): Promise<ContextChunk>;  // ~200-500 tokens
  getDetailed(entityId?: string): Promise<ContextChunk>; // ~500-1500 tokens
}
```

The assembler calls `getSummary()` for secondary context and `getDetailed()` for primary context. This keeps the total payload lean.

**Example: BCA Client Workspace Chat**
```
Primary (detailed):
  → ClientContextProvider.getDetailed('bca-id')     // ~800 tokens
  → ProjectContextProvider.getDetailed('bca-id')     // ~600 tokens
  → WPMaintenanceProvider.getDetailed('bca-id')      // ~400 tokens

Secondary (summary):
  → AnalyticsContextProvider.getSummary('bca-id')    // ~300 tokens
  → ContentCalendarProvider.getSummary('bca-id')     // ~250 tokens
  → GMBContextProvider.getSummary('bca-id')          // ~200 tokens
  → TimeTrackingProvider.getSummary('bca-id')        // ~150 tokens

Total context: ~2,700 tokens + system prompt (500) + conversation history
```

**Example: Dashboard Home Page-Load**
```
All summary-level:
  → HealthContextProvider.getSummary()      // ~200 tokens (Oura score, weight)
  → GoalContextProvider.getSummary()        // ~300 tokens (top 5 goals, status)
  → ProjectContextProvider.getSummary()     // ~250 tokens (active count, overdue tasks)
  → CalendarContextProvider.getSummary()    // ~200 tokens (today's events)
  → WPMaintenanceProvider.getSummary()      // ~150 tokens (overdue count)
  → FinancialContextProvider.getSummary()   // ~200 tokens (spending trend)
  → CustomTrackerProvider.getSummary()      // ~150 tokens (overdue reminders)

Total context: ~1,450 tokens + system prompt (500)
```

**Example: Cross-Domain "How am I doing?" Chat**
```
All detailed (this is the expensive one):
  → HealthContextProvider.getDetailed()     // ~500 tokens
  → FitnessContextProvider.getDetailed()    // ~500 tokens
  → DietContextProvider.getDetailed()       // ~400 tokens
  → FinancialContextProvider.getDetailed()  // ~500 tokens
  → GoalContextProvider.getDetailed()       // ~600 tokens
  → ProjectContextProvider.getSummary()     // ~250 tokens
  → CalendarContextProvider.getSummary()    // ~200 tokens

Total context: ~2,950 tokens + system prompt (500) + conversation history
```

**Layer 4: Query Optimization (what the providers actually run)**
Each provider runs purpose-built queries that return summaries, not raw records:

```sql
-- HealthContextProvider.getSummary() might run:
-- 1. Latest weight + 7-day trend
SELECT value, recorded_at FROM health_metrics
  WHERE metric_type = 'weight' ORDER BY recorded_at DESC LIMIT 7;

-- 2. Today's Oura scores (just 3 numbers)
SELECT readiness_score, sleep_score, activity_score FROM oura_data
  WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE;

-- 3. Any out-of-range blood work flags (just the flags, not all results)
SELECT btr.test_name, btr.value, btr.reference_range, btr.flag
  FROM blood_test_results btr
  JOIN blood_tests bt ON btr.blood_test_id = bt.id
  WHERE bt.test_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days' AND btr.flag IS NOT NULL;
```

These are fast (indexed, milliseconds) and return minimal data. The provider formats the results into a structured text block:

```
[HEALTH SNAPSHOT]
Weight: 192 lbs (↓3 lbs over 7 days)
Oura: Readiness 78, Sleep 82, Activity 65
Blood Work Flags (last 90 days): Vitamin D low (18 ng/mL, ref 30-100)
```

**Layer 5: Conversation History Management**
For multi-turn chat, the system stores messages in AIConversation/AIMessage tables. On each new message:
- Include the last 10-15 turns of conversation
- If conversation exceeds ~20 turns, summarize older messages: run a quick Sonnet call to compress the first N messages into a ~200 token summary
- The summary replaces the full history, keeping the context window manageable
- Conversation context + assembled data context combined should target under 8,000 tokens total for most calls

**Layer 6: Intelligent Caching (Redis)**
Not every Claude call needs to hit the API:

| Cache Type | TTL | Invalidation |
|---|---|---|
| Page-load insights | 4 hours | Invalidated when underlying data changes (new health entry, new task, etc.) |
| Dashboard daily briefing | 4 hours | Invalidated on any significant data change |
| Background weekly rollups | 7 days | Regenerated on schedule |
| Monthly client reports | Until regenerated | Manual or monthly job |
| Sentiment reports | Until regenerated | Monthly job |
| Context provider results | 5-15 minutes | Short TTL, cheap to regenerate |

Cache keys are scoped: `insight:health:page_load`, `insight:client:bca:workspace`, `context:health:summary`, etc.

When data changes (new meal logged, task completed, review synced), the relevant cache keys are invalidated. The next page load triggers a fresh Claude call.

**Layer 7: Cross-Domain Intent Detection (for chat)**
When a chat message comes in, before assembling context, the system does a quick intent check:
- If the message mentions health/body/feeling → include health + fitness + diet providers
- If the message mentions a client name → include that client's providers
- If the message is general/vague ("how's everything?") → go wide with summaries
- If the message is specific ("what did I do for BCA this week?") → go deep on BCA + activity feed

This can be simple keyword/pattern matching — no AI needed for intent detection. A regex-based router handles 90% of cases. Edge cases fall back to "ask Claude with minimal context, let it request more."

#### Cost Management

| Call Type | Model | Est. Context Tokens | Est. Cost per Call |
|---|---|---|---|
| Page-load insight (cached) | None | 0 | $0 |
| Page-load insight (fresh) | Sonnet | 2,000-3,000 | ~$0.003-0.005 |
| Chat message (scoped) | Sonnet | 3,000-5,000 | ~$0.005-0.010 |
| Chat message (cross-domain) | Sonnet | 5,000-8,000 | ~$0.010-0.015 |
| Deep analysis / PM session | Opus | 6,000-12,000 | ~$0.10-0.20 |
| Background insight job | Sonnet | 3,000-5,000 | ~$0.005-0.010 |
| Meeting notes action detection | Sonnet | 1,000-2,000 | ~$0.002-0.004 |
| Content generation (client voice) | Sonnet | 2,000-4,000 | ~$0.005-0.008 |
| Monthly client report | Sonnet | 4,000-6,000 | ~$0.008-0.012 |

With caching, a typical day might involve:
- 5-10 fresh page-load insights (~$0.05)
- 10-20 chat messages (~$0.15)
- 1-2 background jobs (~$0.02)
- Occasional deep analysis (~$0.15)
- **Daily total: ~$0.30-0.50, or $10-15/month typical usage**

#### Extensibility

Adding a new module to the AI system requires:
1. Create a new Context Provider (implements `getSummary()` and `getDetailed()`)
2. Register it in the provider registry
3. Add a row to the context scoping rules (which pages include this provider)
4. Done — Claude now knows about the new data source

This is critical for the "odds and ends" pattern — when Trey thinks of a new thing to track (contact lenses, tax payments, etc.), the flexible Custom Tracker system (Module 32) handles the data, and a single `CustomTrackerProvider` handles all custom trackers' AI context. No new providers needed per tracker.

### Interaction Modes

**1. Page-Load Insights (Automatic)**
- Triggered when navigating to key sections
- Uses Claude Sonnet for speed
- Generates contextual insights displayed at top of page
- Cached for a configurable duration (e.g., refresh every 4 hours) to avoid excessive API calls
- Can be refreshed manually ("Show me fresh insights")
- Insight stored in AIInsight table with triggered_by = "page_load"

**2. Chat (On-Demand)**
- Slide-out panel or dedicated chat view
- Always available from any page
- Context-aware based on current page, but can access anything
- Conversation history preserved
- Supports text and image input (food photos)

**3. Proactive Insights (Background)**
- Generated by scheduled BullMQ jobs
- Stored in AIInsight table
- Surface as notifications/toasts on dashboard
- Types: anomalies, trends, recommendations, alerts, weekly rollups
- Severity-based prioritization (info → urgent)
- Can trigger Twilio SMS for urgent alerts

**4. Action Triggers (AI Does Work)**
- Draft client email from maintenance log (addressed by name)
- Draft SMS to client
- Clean scraped GCE events
- Generate newsletter content
- Build workout (lifting or swimming)
- Build meal plan + shopping list
- Generate social content ideas
- Restructure today's task priorities
- **Generate full project plans with phases, tasks, materials, tools**
- **Calculate material quantities from measurements**
- **Process meeting notes → detect action items → suggest and execute actions on approval**
- Results always presented for review before executing (90% automated, 10% human)

**4a. Meeting Notes → Action Pipeline**
When a note (especially meeting notes) is saved or updated, Claude automatically scans the content for actionable items and surfaces them as suggestions:

- **"Client wants an email blast about spring menu on April 1st"** → Claude suggests: "Add 'Spring Menu Email Blast' to BCA's content calendar for April 1st" → You hit yes → entry created in content calendar with AI-drafted content in BCA's voice
- **"Need to update their homepage hero image by Friday"** → Claude suggests: "Create task 'Update homepage hero image' for BCA, due Friday" → You approve → task created in client workspace
- **"Follow up with them about logo files next week"** → Claude suggests: "Add reminder to email client re: logo files on [date]" → Approved → calendar event or task created
- **"They want to start posting 3x/week on Instagram starting March"** → Claude suggests: "Generate March content calendar for client with 3 posts/week" → Approved → AI drafts full month of content in client voice
- **"Discussed switching to monthly retainer at $X/month"** → Claude suggests: "Add note to client workspace re: retainer discussion" → Logged

**How it works:**
1. Save/update a note tagged as `meeting_notes` (or any note — Claude scans all)
2. Claude parses content, identifies action items with dates, people, and intent
3. NoteAction records are created with `status: pending` and structured action data
4. UI surfaces pending actions as a card/toast: "3 actions detected from your BCA meeting notes"
5. Review each suggestion — accept (Claude executes), edit (modify then execute), or dismiss
6. Accepted actions create real records (tasks, content calendar entries, email plans, calendar events) and link back via `executed_ref_id`

**5. Project Manager Mode (AI Guides Work)**
- Activated per-project when `ai_managed` is enabled
- Claude becomes an active guide, not just an analyst
- **Planning:** Interviews user about scope → generates phased project plan
- **Teaching:** Provides step-by-step instructions for unfamiliar tasks, calibrated to skill level
- **Contextual awareness:** Knows the full project state — what phase you're in, what's been completed, measurements, materials purchased
- **Proactive:** When you open a project, Claude tells you what to focus on today, what to watch out for, and what you need before starting
- **Safety-first:** Flags when professional help is recommended (electrical, plumbing, structural, permits)
- **Adaptive:** If you ask a question mid-phase, Claude answers with full project context rather than generic advice
- **Applies to all project types:** Construction, development, business, creative, learning — each gets contextually appropriate guidance

## 9. Phasing Plan

### Phase 0: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Skeleton app, auth with 2FA, database, deployment pipeline.

- Next.js project setup with TypeScript, Tailwind, Shadcn/ui
- Supabase project setup (database + auth + storage)
- Prisma ORM connected to Supabase PostgreSQL
- Authentication with Supabase Auth (email/password + TOTP 2FA)
- **Login screen** — the military/top-secret design with 2FA flow
- **FBI redirect on failed login**
- Basic dashboard layout (sidebar nav, main content area, header)
- Deployment to Vercel
- Domain configuration (exitframe.org → Vercel)
- Upstash Redis + BullMQ setup for background jobs

**Deliverable:** You can log in at exitframe.org (with 2FA!), failed intruders visit the FBI, and you see an empty but beautiful dashboard.

---

### Phase 1: Project Tracker & Client Workspaces (Week 3-4)
**Goal:** Replace ClickUp immediately. Daily utility from day one.

- Client CRUD (create, edit, archive clients with contact info and service toggles)
- Product CRUD (create, edit, archive products with module config)
- Project management (create projects under any domain/client/product)
- Task management (kanban + list view, priorities, due dates)

- Scrape source configuration
- Event scraping engine (scheduled + manual)
- AI-powered event data cleanup
- Event staging/review interface
- **Featured image handling** — scrape, upload, or assign
- **Publish to The Events Calendar API including featured image**
- Newsletter builder (pull events, layout, reorder, preview)
- **Delete events from newsletter** or **manually add events**
- Newsletter HTML generation
- Push to Sendy (no Zapier)

**Deliverable:** Airtable and Zapier workflows eliminated. Full GCE pipeline in the dashboard.

---

### Phase 9: Calendar, Home & Plants (Week 27-28)
**Goal:** Round out personal tracking and add calendar integration.

- **Twilio reminders** for plants and home maintenance tasks
- Dashboard widgets for all three

**Deliverable:** Every module is live. Google Calendar is integrated. The dashboard is complete.

---

### Phase 10: Polish & Product Integrations (Week 29+)
**Goal:** Integrate products, refine everything, add depth. Products become first-class intelligence hubs.

**Build order matters here — each piece builds on the last:**

**Step 1: Custom Product Metrics (Module 34)**
- User-defined KPIs on any product — define name, unit, format, target value, direction (higher/lower is better)
- Manual value entry + bulk CSV import
- Per-metric line charts, trend indicators, goal lines
- Product workspace "Metrics" tab with configurable card grid
- Quick-entry form for logging all metrics at once (weekly check-in)
- Scheduled reminders ("Log GetShelfed stats every Monday")
- AI trend detection, anomaly alerts, correlation spotting across metrics
- *This alone makes every product workspace useful — no API integration needed*

**Step 2: Generic API Connectors (Module 35)**
- Configure connections to any REST API (Stripe, Gumroad, GitHub, Plausible, Mailchimp, etc.)
- Auth support: API key, bearer token, OAuth 2.0, basic auth, custom header
- Visual endpoint builder: define path, test request, map response fields to Product Metrics
- Sync scheduling via BullMQ (hourly, daily, weekly, manual)
- Dry run mode for testing before going live
- Sync history and health monitoring
- Pre-built connector templates for common services (import → enter credentials → syncing in minutes)
- Encrypted credential storage
- *This replaces the need for bespoke integrations — any new data source is 10 minutes of configuration*

**Step 3: Web Dev Tools Plugin Analytics (Module 33)**
- Freemius API connector (using Module 35 framework) — installs, revenue, licensing, deactivations, geo
- WordPress.org API connector — downloads, ratings, reviews, support threads, version adoption
- AI review sentiment analysis (reuse GMB engine)
- Deactivation analytics and pattern detection
- Development roadmap — version planning, feature tracking linked to project tracker, AI changelog drafting
- Product-specific dashboard widgets — installs, MRR, rating, support, reviews, version adoption, release progress
- *First real-world use of the connector system — proves the architecture*

**Step 4: Remaining Product Integrations**
- GetShelfed admin (game scheduling from dashboard)
- ManlyMan integration (as product matures)
- MLC website integration (quest stats, AI sharing stats)

**Step 5: Platform Polish**
- Dashboard customization (drag/rearrange widgets)
- Command palette (Cmd+K)
- Performance optimization
- Mobile responsiveness pass

**Deliverable:** Every product is a self-service intelligence hub. Define metrics, connect APIs, get charts and AI analysis — no code needed. Web Dev Tools has full plugin analytics as proof of concept. The connector template library means future integrations take minutes, not days.

**Note:** Custom Product Metrics (Step 1) is lightweight enough to pull into an earlier phase if product workspaces feel empty before Phase 10. It has zero dependencies on other Phase 10 features.

### Future: Phase 11 — Android Companion App
- React Native app consuming the same API
- Focus on daily interactions: meal logging (photo), task management, AI chat, shopping list
- Push notifications for insights, plant watering, task reminders, Twilio inbound

---

### Future: Phase 12 — Demo Mode + Architecture Showcase
**Goal:** Showcase the platform to potential customers or collaborators without exposing any real data.

- **Demo mode toggle** — accessible from login screen or via a dedicated URL (e.g., exitframe.org/demo)
- **Synthetic data layer** — pre-generated realistic but fake data across all modules:
  - Fake client workspaces with dummy projects, maintenance logs, analytics
  - Sample health/fitness/diet data showing trends and AI insights
  - Mock financial data, meal plans, shopping lists
  - Example GCE pipeline with scraped events, newsletter preview
  - AI chat interactions demonstrating cross-domain analysis
- **No real data exposed** — demo mode connects to a separate seed dataset, never touches production data
- **Full architecture breakdown page** — accessible within demo mode:
  - Interactive system diagram showing all modules and how they connect
  - Tech stack overview with rationale for each choice
  - API integration map showing all external services
  - Data flow visualization (how data moves from APIs → database → AI → UI)
  - Background job architecture explanation
  - AI context loading strategy breakdown
  - Security model overview (auth, encryption, 2FA)
  - Performance and scaling approach
- **Guided tour option** — optional walkthrough that highlights key features module by module
- **"Built with" credits** — tech stack badges, integration logos
- **Demo mode watermark** — subtle indicator that this is demo data, not live

**Deliverable:** A polished, shareable demo that shows the full power of the platform without any privacy risk. Architecture page serves as both a sales tool and a technical portfolio piece.

## 12. Migration Plan

### ClickUp Notes Export/Import
- **Export:** Use ClickUp's export feature to extract all notes/tasks (CSV or JSON)
- **Transform:** Build a one-time migration script that maps ClickUp data to the Note schema
  - Preserve: title, content, created dates
  - Tag with `imported_from: "clickup"` and `imported_at` timestamp
  - Map ClickUp spaces/folders to appropriate domains (client, product, personal)
- **Import:** Run script to bulk insert into the Notes table
- **Verify:** Side-by-side comparison before decommissioning ClickUp

### Notion LifeTracker
- Manual migration of any historical data worth preserving
- Most value is in the structure/templates, not historical records
- New system supersedes Notion's tracking approach

### Airtable (GCE)
- Export current newsletter event data
- One-time import of any template or recurring event data
- New pipeline replaces the workflow, not just the data

---

## 13. Open Questions & Future Considerations

### Open Questions
1. **Suunto API access:** Verify current API availability and OAuth flow — needs research
2. **Meta API approval:** Business verification process for Facebook/Instagram API access — start early
3. **QBO API setup:** Register app with Intuit, handle OAuth flow for both personal and business accounts
4. **Google Calendar scope:** Read-only sync, or do we want to create/modify events from the dashboard too?
5. **Twilio use cases:** Currently identified — client texts, personal reminders, urgent alerts. Any others?
6. **ClickUp export format:** Need to test export and map fields before building migration script
7. **Custom WP plugin distribution:** How to manage updates to the client-site plugin across all installs

### Resolved Questions
1. ~~Hosting decision~~ → Vercel (Next.js app) + SiteGround (WordPress) + Supabase (DB/auth/storage)
2. ~~Email provider~~ → Gmail API (sends from Trey's email)
3. ~~File storage~~ → Supabase Storage (primary) + AWS S3 (Sendy assets, using credits)
4. ~~Database~~ → Supabase (PostgreSQL) — already using for ManlyMan

### Future Feature Ideas
- Habit tracking system
- Reading/book tracking (separate from Shelf)
- Weather integration for lawn care recommendations
- Invoice/billing module for MLC clients
- Time tracking per client/project
- Integration with banking APIs for automated financial tracking (supplement/replace manual net worth)
- Voice input for quick logging (mobile app)
- Webhooks for real-time data from client sites
- Slack/Discord integration for notifications
- Client portal — let clients view their own project status (way future)

### Security Considerations
- **2FA required** on all logins (TOTP via authenticator app)
- **Failed login → FBI redirect** (security through confusion 😂)
- All API keys and tokens encrypted at rest (Supabase vault)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- CORS configuration for API-first architecture
- Regular dependency audits
- Session timeout and refresh token rotation
- Audit log for sensitive actions (updates pushed to client sites, emails sent)
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Environment variable management via Vercel
